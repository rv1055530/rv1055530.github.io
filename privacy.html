<h1>VYTL Privacy Policy </h1>

<a href="https://vytlfitness.com/support@vytlfitness.com"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="71020401011e0305310708051d1718051f1402025f121e1c">[email&#160;protected]</span></a></p>
<h2>2.	User Consent.</h2>
	By submitting Personal Data through our Application or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
<h2>3.	A Note About Children.</h2>
We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13.  If a child under 13 submits Personal Data to Company and we learn that the Personal Data is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.  If you believe that we might have any Personal Data from a child under 13, please contact us at <a href="https://vytlfitness.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aedddbdedec1dcdaeed8d7dac2c8c7dac0cbdddd80cdc1c380">[email&#160;protected]</a>  
<h2>4.	A Note to Users Outside of the United States.</h2>
	If you are a non U.S. user of the Application, by downloading the Application and providing us with data, you acknowledge and agree that your Personal Data may be processed for the purposes identified in the Privacy Policy.  In addition, your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.  By providing your data, you consent to such transfer.  
<h2>5.	Types of Data We Collect. </h2>
“Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data.  “Anonymous Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons.  We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below.

<ol class ="n"><li>Information You Provide to Us. </li><ul> 
<li>We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, gender, e-mail, state of residence, and password when you create an account to log in to our network (“Account”). 
</li><li>We may collect additional information that you voluntarily submit to us, such as height, weight and age. You are not required to submit such information; however, if you do not, then you may have limited access to certain features and functionality of the Services.
</li><li>We may also collect your interests if you choose to sign up for our newsletter for news and exclusive offers.
</li><li>If you use our Services on your mobile device, including through our Application, we may collect your phone number and the unique device id number.
</li><li>If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store and use that information to provide you with location-based information and advertising.   If you want to deactivate this feature, you can deactivate GPS on your mobile device. 
</li><li>Our Services let you store preferences like how your content is displayed, your location and safe search settings.  We may associate these choices with your ID, browser or the mobile device, and you can edit these preferences at any time.
</li><li>When connecting to our Services via a service provider that uniquely identifies your mobile device, we may receive this identification and use it to offer extended services and/or functionality.
</li><li>Certain Services, such as two-factor authentication, may require our collection of your phone number so that we can send you an SMS message to authenticate your Account.  We may associate that phone number to your mobile device identification information.
</li><li>When you order products or services on our Application, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card information, billing information and shipping information.  We do not store this information directly on our servers, but this information may be shared with third parties who will help process and fulfill your purchases.  
</li><li>We retain information on your behalf, such as files and messages that you store using your Account.
</li><li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply.  
</li><li>When you post content (text, images, videos, photographs, messages, comments or any other kind of content that is not your e-mail address) on our Application, the information contained in your posting will be stored in our servers and other users will be able to see it and any other information that you choose to make public on your public profile page (“Profile”).  When you post messages on the message boards on our Application, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.  Comments on any message boards may be subject to our approval before being posted on the Application. 
</li><li>We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our Application that state that Personal Data is being collected.</li></ul>
</li><li>Information Collected via Technology. 
<ul><li>Information Collected by Our Servers.  To make our Application and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.  
</li><li>Log Files.  As is true of most mobile applications, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes geographic location, how you use the Application, and information about the type of device you use, your Open Device Identification Number (“ODIN”), date/time stamps for your use of the Application, and your unique device identifier (“UDID”). We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Application, track users’ movements around the Application, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.  For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Application or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.  Except as noted in this Privacy Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data. In addition, in the event our Application crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of the Application.
</li><li>Cookies.  Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.  “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a mobile application sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are interacting with the Application.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close the Application) and persistent Cookies (which stay in your Application until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Application.  This type of information is collected to make the Application more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. 
</li><li>Collection of Data by Advertisers.  We may also use third parties to serve ads on the Application.  Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your interaction with the Application, (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number).  They do this by using Cookies, Pixel Tags, or other technologies.  Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Application and the other sites tracked by these third parties.  This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or Pixel Tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies.  You may opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from some of our partners by visiting the websites of such partners.  If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: <a href= "http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices </a>or <a href= "http://www.networkadvertising.org./">http://www.networkadvertising.org. </a>
</li><li>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.  We do not currently respond to “do not track” signals or other mechanisms that might enable Users to opt out of tracking on our site. 
</li><li>Pixel Tags. In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons, or Web bugs).  Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies, that are used to track online movements of Web users.  In contrast to Cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web pages.  Pixel Tags also allow us to send e-mail messages in a format users can read, and they tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of interest to our users.  We may use this information to reduce or eliminate messages sent to a user.  We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Data.
</li><li>Flash LSOs.  When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features.  Flash Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash Cookies, click here: <a href= "http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html.">http://www.macromedia
.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html. </a>
</li><li>Mobile Services.  We may also collect non-personal information from your mobile device if you have downloaded our Application.  This information is generally used to help us deliver the most relevant information to you. Examples of information that may be collected and used include your geographic location, how you use the Application, and information about the type of device you use.  In addition, in the event our Application crashes on your mobile device, we will receive information about your mobile device model software version and device carrier, which allows us to identify and fix bugs and otherwise improve the performance of our Application.  This information is sent to us as aggregated information and is not traceable to any individual and cannot be used to identify an individual.
</li><li>Analytics Services and Interest-Based Advertising.  In addition to the tracking technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit our Application.  This includes third party analytics services, including but not limited to Google Analytics (“Analytics Services”), that we engage to help analyze how users use the Application, as well as third parties that deliver content or offers.  We may receive reports based on these parties’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis.  We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to improve our Application and Services.  The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Application and Services (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services.  The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity.  The Analytics Services may also transfer information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Services’ ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Services’ Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.  By using our Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above.  For a full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at <a href="https://vytlfitness.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="9deee8ededf2efe9ddebe4e9f1fbf4e9f3f8eeeeb3fef2f0b3">[email&#160;protected]</a> We may also partner with ad companies to support our marketing efforts, including by serving you ads better tailored to your likely interests.  If you don’t want to take advantage of these services, you may be able to opt-out by visiting <a href= "http://www.aboutads.info/">http://www.aboutads.info/ </a>or <a href= "http://networkadvertising.org/choices/.">http://networkadvertising.org/choices/. </a> </li></ul></ol> 

<h2>6.	Information Collected from You About Others.</h2>
If you decide to invite a third party to create an Account, we will collect your and the third party’s names and e-mail addresses in order to send an e-mail and follow up with the third party.  We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the third party that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the third party’s names and e-mail addresses as required above.  You or the third party may contact us at <a href="https://vytlfitness.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="deadabaeaeb1acaa9ea8a7aab2b8b7aab0bbadadf0bdb1b3">[email&#160;protected]</a> to request the removal of this information from our database.  As part of your use of the Services, we provide you the opportunity to connect automatically with your friends. We employ various techniques in order to facilitate friends finding each other on our service, including offering contact importer tools to facilitate adding to your contacts (including contacts in your email applications, and/or mobile device contacts list) so that you can more readily ask your contacts to join and communicate with you through the Services.  With your permission, we will access your address book, call log and SMS log, and import your contacts’ names, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, image, geographic location and Facebook IDs to facilitate automatic connection with your friends.  We do this only for contact matching to help your friends and you find each other. Also, when you invite friends to the Services, we will access your mobile device contacts list and we will import your contacts’ names and phone numbers in order to facilitate the invitation. The e-mail that is sent to your friends will come from your e-mail address so that your friends know that you want to invite them to visit the Application.  We may also send an SMS message to invite your friends who we find through your mobile device contacts list. We do not store any passwords you provide as part of the contact import process.  We also collect some settings that help us to interpret your data, such as the language and keyboard settings that you have established, and the phone’s carrier, mobile network code and mobile country code.
<h2>7.	Use of Your Personal Data</h2>
<ol class = "n"><li>General Use.  In general, Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to aid us in serving you better.  We use your Personal Data in the following ways:</li>

</li><li>User Testimonials and Feedback.  We often receive testimonials and comments from users who have had positive experiences with our Services.  We occasionally publish such content.  When we publish this content, we may identify our users by their first and last name.  If you make any comments on a blog or forum associated with any third party site, you should be aware that any Personal Data you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these blogs and forums.
</li><li>Creation of Anonymous Data.  We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.  We use this Anonymous Data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve Application navigation.  We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data and aggregated and other de-identified information for any purpose and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in our sole discretion.</li></ol>
<h2>8.	Disclosure of Your Personal Data.</h2>
We disclose your Personal Data as described below and as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.
<ol class = "n"><li>Third Parties Designated by You.  When you use the Services, the Personal Data you provide will be shared with the third parties that you designate to receive such information, including other websites, your friends, relatives and business associates.  Depending on the type of access you grant to such third parties, they may also be permitted to edit the information you have provided to us and to designate others to access and edit such information.  You may change your settings at any time as to who has access to your information by going to your account settings and changing your publishing options.
</li><li>Users.  We will share your Personal Data with other Users solely for the purpose of providing the Services.
</li><li>Third Party Service Providers.  We may share your Personal Data with third party service providers to:  provide you with the Services that we offer you through our Application; to conduct quality assurance testing; to facilitate creation of accounts; to provide technical support; and/or to provide other services to the Company.  These third party service providers are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Company. 
</li><li>Affiliates.  We may share some or all of your Personal Data with our parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (“Affiliates”), in which case we will require our Affiliates to honor this Privacy Policy.  
</li><li>Corporate Restructuring.  We may share some or all of your Personal Data in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture, or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets.  In the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, Personal Data may also be transferred as a business asset. If another company acquires our company, business, or assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy. 
</li><li>Third Party Platforms.  Some of our Applications and Services may enable you to post content or otherwise integrate or interoperate with third-party platforms, such as Instagram and Spotify (“Third-Party Platforms”).  If you choose to do this, we will provide information to such Third-Party Platforms in accordance with your elections.  You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those websites and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policy of the third party provider of such Third-Party Platform.  We will not be responsible or liable for: (i) the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Platform; (ii) the content, products or services on or availability of such Third-Party Platforms; or (iii) your use of any such Third-Party Platform.
</li><li>Disclosure to Third Party Companies.  We may enter into agreements with companies that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our website (“Third Party Companies”). A Third Party Company may want access to Personal Data that we collect from its customers.  As a result, we may disclose your Personal Data to a Third Party Company; however, we will not disclose your Personal Data to any Third Party Company for the Third Party Company’s own direct marketing purposes, unless you have “opted-in” by following the instructions we provide to allow such disclosure.  If you have opted-in to receive e-mail communications from a Third Party Company and later wish to discontinue receipt of these e-mails, please contact the Third Party Company directly to update your preferences.  The privacy policies of these Third Party Companies may apply to the use and disclosure of your Personal Data that we collect and disclose to such Third Party Companies.  Because we do not control the privacy practices of Third Party Companies, you should read and understand their privacy policies. 
</li><li>Public Profile.  Certain portions of the information you provide to us may also be displayed in the public areas of the Application.  You are solely responsible for applying the appropriate level of access to information you provide to be displayed in the public areas of the Application.  If you do not choose, the system may default to its most permissive setting.  Your photos, posts, and other content you post to the Application are also meant for public consumption.  We may display this content on the Application and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.  Once displayed on publicly viewable web pages, that information can be collected and used by others.  We cannot control who reads your postings or what other users may do with the information that you voluntarily post, so it is very important that you do not put Personal Data in your posts.  Once you have posted information publicly, while you will still be able to edit and delete it on the Application, you will not be able to edit or delete such information cached, collected, and stored elsewhere by others (e.g., search engines).  
</li><li>Protected Health Information.  Any content that you post to the Application may not contain Protected Health information (PHI) as defined under HIPAA. Examples of PHI include information your doctors and health care providers put in your medical record, conversations with your doctor about your care or treatment or payment history if that information can be linked to you as an individual. 
</li><li>Other Disclosures.  Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), Company may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary (a) in connection with any legal investigation; (b) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Company; (c) to protect or defend the rights or property of Company or users of the Application or Services; and/or (d) to investigate or assist in preventing any violation or potential violation of the law, this Privacy Policy, or our Terms of Use.</li></ol>
<h2>9.	Third Party Websites.</h2>
Our Application may contain links to third party websites.  When you click on a link to any other website or location, you will leave our Application and go to another site, and another entity may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you.  We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content.  Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of your Personal Data after you click on links to such outside websites.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website you visit.  The links to third party websites or locations are for your convenience and do not signify our endorsement of such third parties or their products, content or websites.
<h2>10.	Your Choices Regarding Information.</h2>
You have several choices regarding the use of information on our Service:
<ol class = "n"><li>Email Communications.  We will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our Application or Services.  When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive or by contacting us directly (please see contact information below).  Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you service related communications, including notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy.
</li><li>Cookies.  If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept Cookies from our Service for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting a Cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical information. If you do not accept Cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Service or all functionality of the Service. If you have any questions about how to disable or modify Cookies, please let us know at the contact information provided below.
</li><li>Changing or Deleting Your Personal Data.  All users may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Data in their user account by editing their Account via the Services.  If you completely delete all of your Personal Data, then your user account may become deactivated.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request.  We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.  
</li><li>Applications.  You can stop all collection of information by the Application by uninstalling the Application.  You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.  To serve ads in our Application where Cookie technology is not available, the Company hashes users’ device ID.  Users may choose to reset or opt out of anonymous IDs at any time.  If users choose to opt out, ads delivered to the Application by ad serving technology will not be served on an anonymous ID.  You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your location data by changing your settings on your mobile device.</li></ol>
<h2>11.	Security of Credit Card and Bank Account Information.</h2>
For online payments and/or Automated Clearing House (ACH) payouts, we use the payment services of Stripe (https://stripe.com).  We do not process, record or maintain your credit card or bank account information.  For more information on how payments are handled, or to understand the data security and privacy afforded such information, please refer to https://stripe.com/privacy.    
<h2>12.	Changes to This Privacy Policy.</h2>This Privacy Policy is subject to occasional revision, and if we make any material changes in the way we use your Personal Data, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail or push notification to the last e-mail address you provided to us and by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Application.  Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice or push notification to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Application.  These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Service.  Please note that at all times you are responsible for updating your Personal Data to provide us with your most current e-mail address.  In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice.  If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your Personal Data, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to deactivate your Account with us.  Continued use of our Application or Service, following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
